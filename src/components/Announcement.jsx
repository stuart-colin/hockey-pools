          üì¢ 4/20/23 - WELCOME all new competitors!
        </h4>
        <p>
          Wow.... What a start to the playoffs! On top of that, I'm pleased to announce we had an overwhelming number of entries this year, obliterating the former record number of entries (85 entries 2022) with a total of 122 entries!
          I am pleased to have you join our pool that has been consistently growing for 18 years. All of you joined during a transitional year for the pool as we phased out the robust excel spreadsheet supported by macros and formulas and have migrated to a customized webpage. This webpage provides in depth stats surrounding player selections. A big thank you to <b>Colin Stuart</b> and <b>Alan Shields</b> who are the masterminds & coders for building the website. Along with the new website we have created a Discord channel to be used by all the competitors for smack talk, updates, memes, and general chat.
          Congrats to <b>Gary McIvor</b> Who has taken the early lead with 41 points.
        </p>
